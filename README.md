# random_forest_test

This repo contains code to practice starting with random forests in R.
It starts by building a basic decision tree followed by a basic bagging and random forest test.
Finally there are some hints on using the caret package to analyze random forests, perform cross validation and tune hyperparameters.

-- nothing fancy this is just to get you started

I do not claim correctness by any means (;
